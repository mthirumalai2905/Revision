## 2'Complement
* Invert all the bits
* Add 1 to it

__Key Points__:
* XOR with -1 is an alternative to using the ~ (bitwise NOT) operator to invert the bits.
* Both ~n and n ^ -1 will produce the same result for bit inversion.

  **Even or Odd**
  * (n & 1) == 0 It's an even
  * (n & 1) != 0 It's an odd
